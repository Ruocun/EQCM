# EQCM
A Matlab code to analyze electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance data collected on a Biologic potentiostat. Adaption will be needed to analyze your own data. 

The code takes one .mpt file in the folder and output two text files (both Origin friendly)

One contains 7 columns (potential, avg current, std dev current, avg frequency, std dev frequency, avg frequency derivative, std dev frequency derivative.

The other contains charge vs. avg frequency Â± std dev frequency
